Localisation Tools
==================

This is a bash script that is designed to work with [Alfresco](https://github.com/Alfresco/community-edition) and Alfresco's modules e.g. [RM](https://github.com/Alfresco/records-management) and projects e.g. [Aikau](https://github.com/Alfresco/Aikau).

It enables easy management of translation bundles, with the ability to generate (export) a bundle of properties files, import them, as well as perform some automated QA on the files.

For individual projects, it makes use of a l10n.properties file to override configuration, e.g. for the search path used to determine which files should be translated (see [example](https://github.com/davidcognite/Aikau/blob/develop/l10n.properties))
